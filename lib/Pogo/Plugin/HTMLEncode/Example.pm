Pogo::Plugin::HTMLEncode::Example

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Pogo::Plugin::HTMLEncode::MyPlugin;

    sub new { return bless( {}, $_[0] ); }

    sub html_encode {
        my ($self,$data) = @_;

        # manipulate $data recursively...
        ...

        return $data
    }

    sub priority { return 5; }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pogo comes installed with a default scheme (Pogo::Plugin::HTMLEncode::Default)
for encoding user-provided data so that it can safely be displayed in an 
HTML/Javascript context, using HTML::Entities::encode_entities(). For the 
vast majority of users that will work just fine, but some installations 
may require a custom filter to be applied. The plugin architecture allows 
for an easy way to do this.

Essentially you'll provide a set of three required methods in your plugin
module, and then install it in the same directory as this module. As long
as it returns the highest priority of any module in the directory, it will
be loaded and used.


=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=over 4

=item new():

The constructor for the class has to be named new(). It won't be able
to take any parameters.


=item html_encode():

Must deal with recursive data structures


=item priority():

Should just return the priority so that Pogo::HTTP::Server can choose
 a plugin, like:

    sub priority { return 10; }
